In times of notoriously low interest rates, it's hard to find a good place to invest your
hard-earned money without it being slowly eaten up by rising inflation.
Not too long ago, banks still offered high-yield interest accounts with respectable interest
rates that would preserve your wealth and then build some.
Nowadays, offers that are worth a second look are few and far between.

Sure, you can put your money into the stock market.
However, this means considerable effort to find companies to invest in.
Or, if you invest in broad market indices,
it will produce gains that merely recoup the buying power lost to inflation.
If you are looking for investment opportunities that run more or less on autopilot, pose low risk
and still produce proper returns, options are very limited.

## Nexo as an alternative

Modern FinTech companies are now trying to fill this gap.
One of those companies is {{< reflink/nexo >}}, who promises up to 12&#8239;% annual interest rate
on your deposits in Euro, British Pound and US Dollar.
On top of that, Nexo provides competitive interest rates on various crypto currencies, which I will
to get into more detail in another post.

Registration is simple and can be completed entirely online.
If you register with my {{< reflink/nexo "referral link" >}}, you can get a one-time welcome bonus of
10&#8239;USD (as of January 2022).
If you want to utilize everything Nexo has to offer around fiat money like Euro and US Dollar, you
need to go through a KYC-procedur ("Know Your Customer") and verify that you are who you claim to be.
Equipped with laptop, webcam and passport / ID, this is done quickly.

As soon as this is accomplished, you can look into your account page and find the line for your
currency's balance.
Hitting the "Top Up" button opens a pop-up menu with further instructions.
Besides other things, it explains how your funds are insured with Nexo
(more on that [further down](#security)) and how to transfer money into your account.

A critical point is that you transfer new funds from a bank account that is in the same name as the
one you registered with at Nexo and that you provide your "Reference" code in the wire transfer's
subject line.
The funds should arrive in one or two banking days and show up on your account page.
As soon as the money reaches your account, it immediately starts earning interest which is paid out daily.
The actual value of your personal interest rate and whether you in fact receive the promised
"up to 12&#8239;%" depends on a few factors that I'll discuss in the next section.

Withdrawing your money back into a traditional bank account can be done with just a few clicks.
My withdrawals always reached my bank account within one or two days.

## Interest rates

As long as you focus on fiat assets only, you pretty much have two options:
You can either let your money just sit in your account and gather the base interest rate of 4&#8239;%
(as of January 2022); or you can lock it into a "fixed term" for three months to get an extra 4&#8239;%
for a total of 8&#8239;%.
Here, too, the interest is accrued daily and paid out at maturity of the term.
While creating a term, you can check a box so that the term is automatically renewed.
That way, your interest is paid out every three months and
the principal immediately rolls over into the next fixed term.
This automatic renewal setting can be changed throughout the term's runtime up until the last day.

How much you want to invest into one fixed term is completely up to you -- the minimum is one Euro
-- and you can have up to ten fixed terms per currency at the same time.
As an example, you could distribute your funds evenly over six automatically renewing fixed terms trailing
each other by two weeks, respectively.
This way, you would be fully invested, with everything running on
autopilot and interest being paid out consistently every other week.

## ... and NEXO Tokens

Nexo offers a loyalty programme which you can join by investing in their NEXO utility tokens.
A utility token is a crypto currency which is not so much intended for trading and buying goods,
but rather for a specific purpose within a certain project.
The purpose of the NEXO Token is to determine the user's "loyalty" to the Nexo project.
The more NEXO Tokens you have relative to the rest of your portfolio,
the higher the loyalty level you are put into.
The following picture nicely shows the different loyalty levels and their requirements:

{{< gallery/gallery
    caption="Overview of the different Nexo Loyalty Levels: Base, Silver, Gold and Platinum and the ammount of NEXO Tokens neccessary to reach them."

{{< gallery/image
    alt="Nexo Loyalty Level overview"
    src="/img/posts/nexo/en.loyalty_levels.webp"
>}}
{{< /gallery/gallery >}}

The higher your loyalty level, the higher the interest rate you get on your deposits.


In the Silver Level, you receive a 0,25&#8239;% bonus interest on a Euro fixed term.
In the Gold Level, the bonus is 1&#8239;% and in Platinum Level, it's a 2&#8239;% bonus.
The 4&#8239;% bonus for setting up a fixed term still goes on top of that, of course.

By default, the interest is paid in the currency of the principal deposit.
However you do have the option to get your interest paid in NEXO Tokens instead
for an additional 2&#8239;% interest bonus.
If you account for all these interest rate boni, the total rate is indeed 12&#8239;%:

- 4&#8239;% base interest rate
- 4&#8239;% fixed term bonus
- 2&#8239;% receiving interest in NEXO Token
- 2&#8239;% Platinum loyalty bonus

Like other crypto currencies, NEXO Tokens can fluctuate drastically in price
(e.g. between mid-October and mid-November 2021, the price doubled).
Whether or not the 4&#8239;% interest rate bonus for the Platinum Loyalty Level plus the payout in
NEXO Tokens is a sufficient incentive to invest into the NEXO ecosystem is a question everybody has
to answer for themselves.
Even if not, the 8&#8239;% interest rate for three-month fixed terms is considerably higher
than anything classical banks offer these days.

{{< charts/nexo >}}
{{< /gallery/gallery >}}

You also get interest on the NEXO Tokens themselves. The base rate here is 7&#8239;% which can be
further increase by depositing in fixed terms with run time
over three months (2&#8239;% bonus) and 12 months (5&#8239;% bonus).
The tokens can be sold for Euros or exchanged into other crypto currencies anytime directly on
the Nexo website.

## How is Nexo able to service these interest rates?

With such high interest rates, you could ask how Nexo is able to
generate enough revenue to service them sustainably.
As with traditional banks, you can deposit and borrow money at Nexo.
However, in contrast to traditional banks, you can also deposit
your crypto assets as collateral to borrow against.
You can, for example, collateralize your Bitcoins and borrow Euros.
The credit interest rates lie between 7&#8239;% and 14&#8239;%, depending on your Loyalty Level.

## Deposit insurance {#security}

Nexo is a financial institution [registered and regulated](https://nexo.io/security)
in North America, Europe, Australia and Hong Kong.
Part of the regulatory requirements therefrom is providing continuous proof of adequate
equity reserves to ensure that they are able to meet client obligations at all times.
On top of thatc, Nexo is required to perform external audits on a regular basis.
One of the auditors is [Armanino](https://real-time-attest.trustexplorer.io/nexo),
on whose website you can check how well Nexo is covering their obligations in real time.
At the time of writing, their collateral coverage is in "excess of 100&#8239;% of total liabilities".

## Credit card

The Nexo team already announced a credit card with a 2&#8239;% cashback, which you can pay off with
your fiat and crypto portfolio.
According to the preliminary mock-up pictures, it's supposedly to be a Mastercard.
When the card is going to be released I cannot tell, though I did put myself on the waiting list.
