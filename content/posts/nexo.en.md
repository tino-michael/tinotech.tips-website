In times of notoriously low interest rates, it's hard to find a good place to invest one's
hard-earned money without it being slowly eaten up by rising inflation.
Not too long ago, banks still offered high-yield interest accounts with respectable interest
rates that would preserve your wealth and then build some.
Nowadays, offers that are worthy a second look are few and far between.

Sure, you can put your money into the stock market.
Though this means either considerable effort to find companies to invest in or, if invested in
broad market indices, will produce gains that merely recoup the buying power lost to inflation.
If you are looking for investing opportunities that run more or less on autopilot and still produce
proper returns, options are very limited.

## Nexo as alternative

Modern FinTech companies are now trying to fill this gap.
One of those companies is {{< reflink/nexo >}}, who promises up to 12&nbsp;% annual interest rate
on your money deposits in Euro, British Pound and US Dollar.
On top of that, Nexo provides competitive interest rates on various crypto currencies, which I want
to get into more detail in another post.

If you register with my {{< reflink/nexo Referral-Link >}}, you can get a one-time welcome bonus of
25&nbsp;USD.
If you want to utilize everything Nexo has to offer around Fiat money like Euro and US Dollar, you
need to go through a KYC-Prozedur ("Know Your Customer") and verify that you are who you claim to be.
Equipped with laptop, webcam and passport this is done quickly.

As soon as this is accomplished, you can look into your account page and find the line for your
currency's balance.
Hitting the "Top Up" button opens a pop-up menu with further instructions.
Besides other things, it's explained how your funds are insured with Nexo
(more on that [further down](#security)) and how to transfer money into your account.

One important thing is to transfer new funds from a bank account that is in the same name that
you registered with and that you provide your "Reference" code in the wire transfer's subject line.
The funds should arrive in one or two banking days and show up in your account page.
As soon as the money reaches your account, it immediately starts earning interest which is paid out daily.
The actual magnitude of your personal interest rate and whether you actually receive the promised
"up to 12&nbsp;%" depends on a few factors.

Withdrawing your money back into a traditional IBAN account can be done with just a few clicks.
My withdrawals always reached my bank account within one or two days.

## Interest rates

As long as you are focusing on fiat assets only, you pretty much have two options:
You can either let your money just sit in your account and gather the base interest rate of 4&nbsp;%
(as of November 2021); or you can put it into a "fixed term" of three months to get another 4&nbsp;%
on top for a total of 8&nbsp;%.
Here, too, the interests are calculated daily but collected throughout the term and only paid out
at the end.
During creation of each term, you can check a box so that the term is automatically renewed.
That way, you get your interests paid out every three months and the remainder immediately reinvested.
This automatic renewal setting can be changed throughout the term's runtime up until the last day.

How much you want to invest into one fixed term is completely up to you -- the minimum is one Euro
-- and you can have up to ten fixed terms per currency at the same time.
As an example, you could distribute your funds over six automatically renewing fixed terms trailing
each other by two weeks, respectively.
This way, you would be fully invested, everything runs on autopilot and you get your interest paid
out consistently every two week.

## ... and NEXO Tokens

Nexo offers a loyalty programme which you can join by investing in their NEXO utility tokens.
A utility token is a crypto currency which is intended less for trading and buying goods and more
for a specific purpose within a certain project.
For the NEXO Token the purpose is to determine the user's "loyalty" to the Nexo project.
The more NEXO Tokens you have relative to the rest of your portfolio,
the higher the loyalty level you are put into.
The following picture nicely shows the different loyalty level and their requirements:

{{< gallery/gallery
    caption="Overview of the different Nexo Loyalty Levels: Base, Silver, Gold and Platinum and the ammount of NEXO Tokens neccessary to reach them."

{{< gallery/image
    alt="Nexo Loyalty Level overview"
    src="/img/posts/nexo/en.loyalty_levels.webp"
>}}
{{< /gallery/gallery >}}

The higher your loyalty level the higher the interest rate you get for your deposits.
In the Silver Level, you get a 0,25&nbsp;% bonus on your Euro interests.
In Gold Level, the bonus is 1&nbsp;& and in Platinum Level, it's a 2&nbsp;% bonus.
The 4&nbsp;% bonus for setting up a fixed term still goes on top of that of course.

By default, the interests are paid in the same currency that you are saving in.
Though you have the option to get your interests paid in NEXO Tokens instead for an additional 2&nbsp;%
interest bonus. If you account for all these interest rate boni, the total rate is indeed at 12&nbsp;%:

- 4&nbsp;% base interest rate
- 4&nbsp;% fixed term bonus
- 2&nbsp;% getting paid out in NEXO Token
- 2&nbsp;% Platinum loyalty bonus

Like other crypto currencies, NEXO Tokens can fluctuate drastically in price
(e.g. between mid-October and mid-November 2021, the price doubled).
Whether or not the 4&nbsp;% interest rate bonus for the Platinum Loyalty Level plus payout in NEXO
Tokens is a sufficient incentive to invest into the NEXO ecosystem is a question everybody has to
answer for oneself.
Even if not, the 8&nbsp;% interest rate for three months fixed terms is a lot more than anything
classical banks offer these days.

You also get interests on the NEXO Tokens themselves. The base rate here is 7&nbsp;% which can be
further increase with fixed terms over three months (2&nbsp;% bonus) and 12 months (5&nbsp;% bonus).
The tokens can be sold for Euros or exchanged into other crypto currencies anytime directly on
the Nexo website.

## How is Nexo able to service these interest rates?

With saving's interest rates that high, one could ask how Nexo is able to generate enough revenue to
service them sustainably.
Like with traditional banks, at Nexo you can deposit and borrow money.
In contrast to traditional banks, here you can also deposit your crypto currencies as collateral to
borrow against.
You can, for example, collateralize your Bitcoins and borrow Euros.
The credit interest rates for lie are between 7&nbsp;% and 14&nbsp;%, depending on your Loyalty Level.

## Deposit insurance {#security}

Nexo is a financial institution [registered and regulated](https://nexo.io/security)
in North America, Europa, Australia and Hong Kong.
Part of the regulatory requirements therefrom is the providing of continuous proof of adequate
equity reserves to ensure that they are able to meet client obligations at all times.
On top, Nexo is required to perform external audits on a regular basis.
One of these Auditors is [Armanino](https://real-time-attest.trustexplorer.io/nexo), one whose
website one can check in real time how well Nexo is covering their obligations.
At the time of writing their collateral coverage is in "excess of 100&nbsp;% of total liabilities".

## Credit card

The Nexo team already announced a credit card with a 2&nbsp;% cashback, which one can pay off with
one's fiat and crypto portfolio.
According to the preliminary mock-up pictures, it's supposedly to be a Mastercard.
When the card is going to be released I cannot tell, though I did put myself onto the waiting list.
